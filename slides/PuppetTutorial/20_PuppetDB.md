# Introduction to PuppetDB
PuppetDB is a "fast, scalable and reliable" data warehouse for Puppet.

It saves data generated by Puppet: nodes' **facts**, **catalogs** and **reports**.

It can also work as a performant backend for **exported resources** being a recommended alternative to the older ActiveRecord storeconfigs interface.

It provides a faster backend also for Puppet's **Inventory Service**.

PuppetDB is [opensource](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetdb), written in Clojure (it requires >= JDK 1.6 and PuppetMasters with Puppet >= 2.7.12), and is delivered as an autonomous software.

The best source from where to retrieve it are the official [Puppetlabs repositories](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/puppetlabs_package_repositories.html#open-source-repositories).


# PuppetDB installation
For a complete overview of the installation process check the official documentation and choose between installatio from [puppetdb module](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppetdb/latest/install_via_module.html) or from [packages](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppetdb/latest/install_from_packages.html).

PuppetDB can persist data either on an embedded HSQLDB database or on PostgreSQL.
The latter is definitively recommended on production environment where there are a few dozens of servers or more.

The configuration files are:

```/etc/sysconfig/puppetdb``` (```/etc/default/puppetdb``` on Debian) is the init script configuration file, here you can set JAVA settings like JAVA_ARGS or JAVA_BIN

```/etc/puppetdb/conf.d/``` is the configuration directory, here you may have different .ini files where to configure **[global]** settings, **[database]** backends, **[command-processing]** options, **[jetty]** parameters for HTTP connections and **[repl]** settings for remote runtime configurations (used for development/debugging).

```/etc/puppetdb/log4j.properties``` is the logging config file based on Log4j.

```/etc/puppet/puppetdb.conf``` is the configuration file for **Puppet** with the settings to be used by the PuppetDB terminus


# PuppetDB console and tools

#### Integrated console: Anaylize PuppetDB performance
PuppetDB provides a performances dashboard out of the box, you can use it to check how the software is working: **http://<puppetdb.server>:8080/dashboard/**.
This is integral part of the PuppetDB software.

#### Puppet Board: Query PuppetDB from the web
A nice frontend that allows interrogation of the PuppetDB from the web is [PuppetBoard](https://github.com/nedap/puppetboard).
This software is contributed from the community.

#### Puppetdbquery module: Query PuppetDB from Puppet manifests
An incredibly useful module that provides faces, functions and hiera backends that work with PuppetDB is the [puppetdbquery module](https://github.com/dalen/puppet-puppetdbquery). You can install it also from the Forge:

      puppet module install dalen-puppetdbquery

This software is contributed from the community (and is becoming a standard de facto for PuppetDB querying inside Puppet modules).


# PuppetDB API
PuppetDB exposes an [HTTP API](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppetdb/latest/api/) that uses a Command/Query Responsibility Separation (CQRS) pattern:

#### REST for reading
A standard REST API is used to query data.

The current (API v3) available endpoints are: ```metrics```, ```fact-names```, ```facts```, ```nodes```, ```resources```, ```reports```, ```events```, ```event-counts```, ```aggregate-event-counts```, ```server-time```
  

#### COMMANDS for writing
Explicit **commands** are used (via HTTP using the /commands/ URL) used to populate and modify data.

The current [**commands**](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppetdb/latest/api/commands.html) are: ```replace catalog```, ```replace facts```, ```deactivate node```, ```store report```.


### API versions  
There are different versions of the APIs as they evolve with PuppetDB versions.

As October 2013, Version 1 of the API is deprecated, Version 2 and 3 (the latter adds new endpoints and is recommended) are both supported.

You can access a specific version of the API using the relevant prefix: 

    http[s]://puppetdb.server/v#/<endpoint>/[NAME]/[VALUE][?query=<QUERY STRING>]

### Query language
Queries to the REST endpoints can define search scope and limitations for the given endpoint. The query are sent as an "URL-encoded JSON array in prefix notation". Check the online [tutorial](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppetdb/latest/api/query/tutorial.html) for details.
