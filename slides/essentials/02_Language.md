# Puppet Language

  - A **Declarative** Domain Specific Language (DSL)

  - Defines **STATES** (Not procedures)

  - Puppet code stays in **manifests** (files .pp)

  - Code contains **resources** that affects elements of the systme (file, package, service ...)

  - Resources are often grouped in **classes** which are generally organized in **modules**

  - **Variables** may be defined nodes and can be Facts (generated from the node) or User defined

  - On the Master are defined the resources or classes to include on the **nodes** (clients)

  - All the resources to apply on a node are defined in the **catalog**, generated by the Master


# Resource Types (Types)

  - Resources are single **units of configuration** composed by:
    A **type** (package, service, file, user, mount, exec ...)
    A **title** (how is called and referred)
    One or more **arguments**

        type { 'title':
          argument  => value,
          other_arg => value,
        }

  - Example for a **file** resource type:

        file { 'motd':
          path    => '/etc/motd',
          content => 'Tomorrow is another day',
        }

  - Complete [Type Reference Online](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/references/3.0.0/type.html) or at the command line

        puppet describe file

  - Give a glance to Puppet code for the list of **native** resource types:

        ls $(facter rubysitedir)/puppet/type


# Simple samples of resources

  - Installation of OpenSSH package

        package { 'openssh':
          ensure => present,
        }

  - Creation of /etc/motd file

        file { 'motd':
          path => '/etc/moth',
        }

  - Start of httpd service

        service { 'httpd':
          ensure => running,
          enable => true,
        }


# More Complex examples of resources

  - Installation of Apache package with the correct name for different OS

        package { 'apache':
          ensure => present,
          name   => $operatingsystem {
            /(?i:Ubuntu|Debian|Mint)/ => 'apache2',
            default                   => 'httpd',
          }
        }

  - Management of nginx service with parameters defined in module's variables

        service { 'nginx':
          ensure     => $nginx::manage_service_ensure,
          name       => $nginx::service,
          enable     => $nginx::manage_service_enable,
          require    => Package['nginx'],
        }

  - Creation of /etc/nginx/nginx.conf with content retrived from different possible sources (first found is provided)

        file { 'nginx.conf':
          ensure  => present,
          path    => '/etc/nginx/nginx.conf',
          require => Package['nginx'],
          notify  => Service['nginx'],
          source  => [ "puppet:///modules/site/nginx/nginx.conf--${fqdn}",
                       "puppet:///modules/site/nginx/nginx.conf-${role}",
                       "puppet:///modules/site/nginx/nginx.conf" ],
          }
        }


# Resource Abstraction Layer

  - Resources are abstracted from the underlining OS

  - Resource Types have different providers for different OS

  - Package type is known for the great number of providers

         ls $(facter rubysitedir)/puppet/provider/package

  - Use **puppet resource** to interrogate the RAL:

        puppet resource user

        puppet resource user root

        puppet resource package

        puppet resource service

  - Or to directly modify resources:

        puppet resource service httpd ensure=running enable=true


# Classes

  - Classes are **containers** of different resources. Since Puppet 2.6 they can have parameters

  - Example of a class **definition**:

        class mysql {
          package { 'mysql-server':
            ensure => present,
          }
          service { 'mysql':
            ensure    => running,
            enable    => true,
            require   => Package['mysql-server'],
            subscribe => File['my.cnf'],
           }
         [...]
        }

  - Usage (declaration) of "old style" classea (without parameters):
    Even if a class is a singleton, you can include it multiple times: it's applied only once.

        include mysql

  - Usare (declaration) of a parametrized classes
    You can declare a parametrized class only once for a node

        class { 'mysql':
          required_param  => 'my_value',
          $optional_parma => 'dont_like_defaults',
        }


# Defines

  - Also called: **Defined resource types** or **defined types**

  - Similar to parametrized classes but can be used multi times, with different parameters

  - **Definition** example:

        define apache::virtualhost (
          $template   = 'apache/virtualhost.conf.erb' ,
          [...]
          ensure => 'present' ) {

          file { "ApacheVirtualHost_${name}":
            ensure  => $ensure,
            content => template("${template}"),
          }
        }

  - Usage example (**declaration**):

        apache::virtualhost { 'www.example42.com':
          template => 'site/apache/www.example42.com-erb'
        }



# Variables

  - You need them to provide different configurations for different kind of servers

  - Can be provided by client nodes as **facts**

    **Facter** runs on clients and collects **facts** that the server can use as variables

        al$ facter

        architecture => x86_64
        fqdn => Macante.example42.com
        hostname => Macante
        interfaces => lo0,eth0
        ipaddress => 10.42.42.98
        ipaddress_eth0 => 10.42.42.98
        kernel => Linux
        macaddress => 20:c9:d0:44:61:57
        macaddress_eth0 => 20:c9:d0:44:61:57
        memorytotal => 16.00 GB
        netmask => 255.255.255.0
        operatingsystem => Centos
        operatingsystemrelease => 6.3
        osfamily => RedHat
        virtual => physical

  - Or can be defined by users


# User Variables

  - You can define custom variables in different ways:

  - In Puppet manifests:

        $role = 'mail'

        $package = $operatingsystem ? {
          /(?i:Ubuntu|Debian|Mint)/ => 'apache2',
          default                   => 'httpd',
        }

  - In an External Node Classifier (Puppet DashBoard, the Foreman, Puppet Enterprise)

  - In an Hiera backend

        $syslog_server = hiera(syslog_server)


# Nodes

  - A node is identified by the PuppetMaster by its **hostname** or **certname**

  - You can decide what resources, classes and variables to assign to a node in 2 ways:

    Using Puppet language ( Starting from /etc/manifests/site.pp )

        node 'web01' {
          include apache
        }

    Using an External Node Classifier (DashBoard, Foreman or custom scripts)

  - When a client connects a PuppetMaster builds a **catalog** with all the resources to apply on the client

    The catalog is in Pson format (a Puppet version of Json)
